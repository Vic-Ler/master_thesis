## 📄 Thesis Overview

This project investigates cloud motion tracking using UV images captured by the Emirates Mars Mission (Hope Probe). The goal was to derive wind field estimations and visualize the atmospheric dynamics of Mars. The methods combine image preprocessing, CIV (Correlation Image Velocimetry), and vector field analysis.
