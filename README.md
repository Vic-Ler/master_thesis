# Master Thesis: Measuring Martian winds by tracking clouds in Emirates Mars Mission UV imaging
This repository contains the code written for my master thesis in Python. Results that were obtained by the computations can be found in the image_material folder which also includes an overview file. 
A summary of the code can be found in the PDF "00_overview_supplementary_code.pdf" located in the supplementary_code folder.
